# Project Overview

This project utilizes the following technology stack and tools to build and maintain a robust and efficient backend application.

## Technology Stack

### Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is widely used for building APIs and web servers due to its simplicity and performance.

### Mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data, making it easier to interact with MongoDB within a Node.js environment.

## Important Libraries

### bcryptjs
bcryptjs is a JavaScript library used to hash passwords. It provides a robust and secure way to handle password hashing, ensuring that user passwords are stored securely.

### jsonwebtoken
jsonwebtoken is a library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, allowing secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object.

### mongoose
As mentioned, Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js. It helps manage relationships between data, provides schema validation, and translates between objects in code and their representation in MongoDB.
